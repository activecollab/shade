* Title: Publishing What's New Article
* Slug: new-whats-new-article

================================================================

Writing a What's New article is similar to writing a <{page name='new-book-page'}>book pages<{/page}>. Document structure is the same as other help documents, and list of arguments is the same as list of arguments for pages:

<{sub}>Title<{/sub}>

Article title (optional). If it is omitted, system will use name of the article file (sans order number and file extension) as article title.

<{sub}>Slug<{/sub}>

Article slug (optional). If it is omitted, system will automatically convert article title to slug format (<{term}>Cool New Feature<{/term}> will become <{term}>cool-new-feature<{/term}>).
