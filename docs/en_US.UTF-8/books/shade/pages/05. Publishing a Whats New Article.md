* Title: Publishing What's New Article
* Slug: new-whats-new-article

================================================================

What's New articles are a way to have a simple, blog like section in your documentation where you can describe relevant changes and new features. These articles go under <{path}>/whats_new<{/path}> subfolder of your project and they are organized by version:

<{code}>/my-project
- /whats_new
-- /1.0.0
--- /images
--- /01. Initial Release.md<{/code}>

Writing a What's New article is similar to writing a <{page name='new-book-page'}>book pages<{/page}>. You can use the same <{page name="help-file-anatomy"}>formatting guide<{/page}> and list of available attributes is short:

<{sub}>Title<{/sub}>

Article title (optional). If it is omitted, system will use name of the article file (sans order number and file extension) as article title.

<{sub}>Slug<{/sub}>

Article slug (optional). If it is omitted, system will automatically convert article title to slug format (<{term}>Cool New Feature<{/term}> will become <{term}>cool-new-feature<{/term}>).
