* Title: Building a Website
* Slug: build-website

================================================================

To build a help website from the code, navigate to the folder where your project is defined and run:

<{code inline=false}>shade build<{/code}>

Build target (directory where built files are added) can be rovided to the command as <{code}>--target<{/code}> option:

<{code inline=false}>shade build --target=~/Temp<{/code}>

If it is not provided, system will check if there is a value set for <{code}>default_build_target<{/code}> option in <{path}>project.json<{/path}> and use it if it is set. If it is missing as well, system will build in <{path}>/build<{/path}> folder of the project.

More info on build command can be found in <{page name="commands" section="build"}>this article<{/page}>.
