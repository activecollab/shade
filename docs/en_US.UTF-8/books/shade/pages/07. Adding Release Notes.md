* Title: Adding Release Notes
* Slug: new-release

================================================================

Release notes are used to record all the small changes and new features that happen between releases of your product. Release notes are added to <{path}>/releases<{/path}> subfolder, where their names are versions of the product:

<{code}>/my-project
- /releases
-- /1.0.0.md
-- /1.0.1.md<{/code}>

As per recommendation on [keepachangelog.com](http://keepachangelog.com) you should have sections like this:

* <{term}>Added<{/term}> for new features.
* <{term}>Deprecated<{/term}> for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.
* <{term}>Removed<{/term}> for deprecated features removed in this release.
* <{term}>Fixed<{/term}> for any bug fixes.
* <{term}>Security<{/term}> to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.

While these are just a friendly recommendation, we went a step further and added release-notes specific blocks that you can use to better format your notes:

<{code}><{literal}><{added}>

* Great new feature
* Awesome enhancement
* Etc

<{/added}>
<{deprecated}>…<{/deprecated}>
<{removed}>…<{/removed}>
<{fixed}>…<{/fixed}>
<{security}>…<{/security}><{/literal}><{/code}>

Available attributes:

<{sub}>Release Date<{/sub}>

Date when this release was shipped, in YYYY-MM-DD format. Value of this attribute is optional.
