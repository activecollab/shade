================================================================

Shade is build around single principle: **documentation should be where your code is**. When it is there instead of being in an  silo that is isolated from your code you can:

1. Version it just the way you version your code,
2. Use the same workflow (ex GitFlow) that you use for development to prepare the documentation for the big launch,
3. Draft the documentation or write notes for documentation team long before your app becomes stable.

Our team experienced a problem when a release was ready long before the documentation and had to be shipped with incomplete documentation. After letting our customers down like that, we sat and agreed that Documentation should be a column on our Kanban board, just like Development or Testing. That also mean that documentation should be written as code gets written, using the same tools that we use to program. That made Shade what it is today:

1. VCS and workflow friendly. We (heart) GitFlow,
2. Uses Markdown + a couple of special tags. This means that you can use your favorite plain text editor instead of cumbersome WYSIWYG widget in a small web page,
3. Builds static website instead of being a database powered web app. It's simple, yet powerful. And performance is awesome,
4. Integrates with the eco-system instead of reinventing all the elements.
